[section Rationale]

[heading Size and Index Types]

Signed values as sizes are advantageous for a number of reasons:

# When doing math with sizes, intermediate values can be negative (which makes
  sense), instead of wrapping around to a very large value (which does not).

# Optimizers produce better code generation in more situations for signed
  values.

# Signed values lead naturally to the negative-indexable slicing that _Text_
  uses.

This last point is particularly important.  I think that negative indexing
should be allowed on all random access ranges.


[heading `char const *` Iterators]

_s_ and _sv_ both use `char const *` as their forward iterator types.  This
allows interoperability with C strings and arrays of `char`.


[heading Where Are `data()`, `c_str()`, `front()`, and `back()`?]

_s_ does not have any of these, even though `std::string` does.  Since
`string::iterator` is just `char const *`, and _s_ is always null-terminated,
`data()`, `c_str()`, and `begin()` are synonyms.  Synonyms bad.  Small
interfaces good.


[heading Inserting Null Terminated Sequences]

The _s_ inserting interfaces (`insert()` and `replace()`) remove explicit null
terminators from inserted _svs_ and _rsvs_, because leaving them in is almost
certainly an error.  This can still be accomplished by directly writing
through the index operator or an iterator, or by inserting
`string_view("\0")`.


[heading _s_, _t_, _ur_ and _r_ Are Implicitly Convertible from `char const *`.]

I find that the syntactic overhead of bringing UDLs into scope and then using
them to be too high in some cases.  Aggregate initialization including
string-like objects is one of those:

[table Explicit vs. Implicit Conversion from `char const *`
    [[Explicit] [Implicit]]
    [[``
    using namespace boost::text::literals;

    std::array<boost::text::string, 3> = {{ "foo"_s, "bar"_s, "baz"_s }};
``]
    [``
    std::array<boost::text::string, 3> = {{ "foo", "bar", "baz" }};
``]]
]

I find the implicit-conversion code much more natural.


[heading None of the _Text_ String Types Does Formatted Output]

This is necessary because a single `char` is not a code point, and a even
single code point does not correspond to a single formatted output glyph.
This means that the layout/spacing of the output is not something _Text_ can
determine.  Higher-level code must deal with such issues.


[heading Unicode Algorithm Tailoring]

The behavior of some of the Unicode algorithms is intended to be tailorable.
_Text_ provides customization of some of its Unicode algorithm implementations
for this purpose.  Some possible tailorings are not available.

* Grapheme breaks are not tailorable, because they are fundamental to how a
  large part of _Text_ operates; everyone must have the same sense of what a
  _gr_ is for this to work.

* Word breaks are tailorable.  The tailorings available via _Text_'s word
  breaking API should be enough handle most of the shortcomings listed in the
  _text_seg_notes_.  The shortcomings not covered by _Text_'s API require
  dictionary lookups (very much out of scope) or extra _cp_ properties (for
  breaking on script boundaries; also out of scope).

* Sentence breaks are not tailorable, because the suggested tailorings require
  a large amount of context, and possibly dictionary-style lookups.

* Line breaks are not tailorable, because all the suggested tailorings involve
  multiple modes of behavior (e.g. for Korean text) or dictionary lookups.

* For bidirectional ordering, Unicode lays out certain tailorings it refers to
  as _bidi_h_tailorings_.  _Text_ directly supports HL1 and HL4.  HL2 is
  unsupported because it frankly doesn't seem very important.  HL3 and HL5 can
  be accomplished by manually adding directional formatting characters or
  other desired _cps_ to segments of text.  HL6 is completely unsupported,
  because it also seems like a very low-frequency use case.


[heading _Text_ Does Not Use allocators]

Allocators are too low gain for the cost they impose.  How many
`std::basic_string` template instantiations in the code bases of the world
involve a non-default allocator?  I would be surprised if it was as high as
1%.  Allocators may once have served an important function, but in modern C++
are a perfect example of not sticking to "Don't pay for what you don't use."

As a concrete example, consider `std::vector`.  This is a type whose sole
purpose is to manage the allocations and reallocations of a heap-allocated
array for you.  Its interface allows me, via its allocator template parameter,
to change its behavior to be a stack-allocated array of fixed size, but with a
`std::vector` interface.  This has a large impact on the properties of the
type, the `noexcept`-ness of and time complexity of `swap()` to name just
one. I don't consider this to be a feature of the `std::vector` design, but a
bug.
